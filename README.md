# Credit-card-fraud-detection
In this project several machine learning algorithms were used to detect fraud credit card transactions efficiently. Atlast we have compared all the results from the algoritms and have found out which one is the best. We have got a great accuracy of 99.95% from Random Forest Classifier. I have uploaded two seperate .ipynb files which contains the whole project and also uploaed the PDF format project for detailed explanation.

## Dataset Information
The dataset for our analysis is from Kaggle which is one of the most used platforms by the future Data Scientists. It has 31 columns out of which 28 are named as v1-v28. Others are ‘Time’, ‘Class’, ‘Amount’. ‘Time’ represents the time gap between the transactions on the dataset. ‘Amount’ is the amount of money that had been withdrawnor transferred. ‘Class’ has two values ‘0’ and ‘1’ where ‘0’ represents a genuine transaction and ‘1’ represents a fraud one.
